            <p>Hi, I'm Carlos, a London-based aspiring frontend developer. My path to becoming a developer has been anything but conventional. For the past six years, I have worked as a Welfare Rights Adviser, using my law degree to analyse complex situations and advocate for those in need. This role has taught me the importance of meticulous problem-solving and clear communication, skills that I am now channelling into the world of technology.</p>
            <p>My journey began at 14 years old when I moved to the UK without speaking a word of English. That experience taught me resilience and the drive to succeed based on merit alone. After feeling that my growth in the legal field was limited by factors outside of my control, I was inspired to make a change. Technology, to me, represents a field where aptitude and the quality of your work are what truly matter.</p>
            <p>I am now committed to this new chapter, bringing the skills from my legal background to my goal of becoming a proficient developer.</p>

            <h2 class="headings">My learning journey</h2>
            <p>Currently, I am on a structured and intensive journey to become a proficient frontend developer, with the clear goal of landing my first role by May 2026. My learning is guided by a comprehensive plan, kindly drafted by my brother-in-law, friend, and mentor, where the goal is not just acquiring knowledge but practical, real-world skills.</p>
            <h3 class="headings">My approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Project-Based Learning:</strong> Learning by doing. Every new technology I learn is immediately applied to a project that becomes part of my portfolio.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Professional Practices:</strong> Enhancing and putting into practice the core skills of a professional developer: communication, problem-solving, and collaboration.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning in the Open:</strong> My goal is to document my entire process on GitHub. Follow my progress as I move from the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into advanced frameworks and technologies like TypeScript and React.</li>
            </ul>
